== cloudia ==

A MapReduce Cloud Framework

Under development - don't expect to be able to do much right now.

== cloning and setup ==

I recommend you to use virtualenv:

pip install virtualenv
mkdir cloudia_env
cd cloudia_env
virtualenv --no-site-packages .
source bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:moret/cloudia.git
cd cloudia
pip install -r requirements.pip

== developing ==

Make sure you've started your virtualenv, run the tests, code, test again and so on:

source bin/activate
cd cloudia
paver tests

== running ==

Again, make sure you've started your virtualenv and simply run the server:

source bin/activate
cd cloudia
paver run

And point your browser to http://lvh.me:8888/ if your connected to the internet, or http://0.0.0.0:8888/ if not.

Have fun!
